Adding a new host tasks:
- Add the host to my ~/.ssh/config file
- Create a host_vars file for the new host.
  I must at least specify the following variables:
    - ip
- Add the host entry to my /etc/hosts file
- Configure the virtual machine to autostart
- If the host already existed and I am reusing it:
  * Rename the hostname
  * Configure the network settings so that I can SSH into it
  * Rename the KVM virtual machine label
