Configures HAProxy.

Expects that the certbot client was used to install certificates onto one of the servers.
This host must be specified in the variable 'certHost'.
The certificates will be fetched from that server, and then distributed to all Load balancers.

This role is not flexible for HAproxy. It uses a template that meets my needs, but more than likely
won't meet yours. I would swap out the haproxy.cfg.j2 template with your own


Role enables HAProxy stats at url https://load-balancer:443/haproxy?stats

Required Variables:
  - certHost - Host where certbot was ran to acquire certificate from Letsencrypt
  - domain
  - statsUser # Stats username and password credentials when prompted for stats
  - statsPass
  - backends - complex dictionary to describe your routing. Here is what I use as an example:

backends:
  - jenkins:
     servers:
       - name: cicd-01
         ip: 192.168.122.1
         port: 8080
     reqirep: ^([^\ :]*)\ /jenkins/(.*)     \1\ /jenkins/\2
  - icinga:
      servers:
        - name: mon-01
          ip: 192.168.122.2
          port: 80
      reqirep: ^([^\ :]*)\ /icingaweb2/(.*)     \1\ /icingaweb2/\2
  - kibana:
      servers:
        - name: log-01
          ip: 192.168.122.3
          port: 5601
      reqirep: ^([^\ :]*)\ /kibana/(.*)     \1\ /kibana/\2
