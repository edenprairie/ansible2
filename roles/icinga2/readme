WARNING: THIS ROLE USES PHP-FPM AND REMOVES PHP FROM APACHE

WARNING: The icinga web app is SUPPOSED to create the icingaweb database for you.
         It was NOT exhibiting this behavior. I instead had to modify the 
         postgresql role to ensure the database was created with the schema
         located at /usr/share/doc/icingaweb2/schema/pgsql.schema.sql that is
         in the icingaweb2 package


Configures icinga2 with a postgresql backend.
Configures the api, and api root user

Installs icingaweb2, and gets everything running,  but you must go to the endpoint, and follow the documentation
for configuring the web portal.


Required variables:
  - icingaPassword - Postgresql password for the icinga role
  - apiPassword  - password for root account to authenticate api calls
  - icingaWebPassword - password for icinga Web to access the api
  - timezone  - your timezone that is used in the php.ini file
