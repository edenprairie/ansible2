Ensures that the system has required repos installed.

This is a complex role. You will probably want to view the actuall tasks to get a better idea of whats executing.

The role requires the 'axios' and 'htmlparser2' modules be installed in the role_path/files directory.
The role checks that centos-release is installed properly. If it is missing repo files it will remove
the package. Unfortunately, we cant just run 'yum install centos-releaes' because now we have no repo files pointing anywhere.
We must then run a script pointing to the Centos repos. We will parse the package names, and get the URL of the latest centos-release package. We will then install that package

The following repositories will be installed:
  - centos-release
  - epel-release
  - nodesource

Role Variables:
  invalidRepos: list of filenames that should not exist in /etc/yum.repos.d
