Configures Postgresql server

Installs Postgres, initiates the server, configures syslog, enables the firewall, and starts the service.
Role Features:
  - HBA entries

This role will also execute the SQL file 'configure.sql' if it exists in your roles 'files' directory. This file can be any valid SQL commands to run against the server. I personally use it to configure roles. It's kind of my catch all section for areas where im too lazy to put it in the Ansible role itself.

optional files:
  - configure.sql

required variabes:
  - dataDir - directory which contains postgresql.conf, and pg_Hba.conf, etc
  - maxConnections - number of maximum connections allowed to the server
  - network - CIDR notation variable specifying what hosts can connect with an MD5 password

HBA Entries can be specified with the following variable declarations:
hba:
  - entryName:
      type:
      database:
      user:
      address:
      method:
