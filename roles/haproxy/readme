Configures HAProxy.

Expects that the certbot client was used to install certificates onto one of the servers.
This host must be specified in the variable 'certHost'.
The certificates will be fetched from that server, and then distributed to all Load balancers.

This role is current unusable for anyone but myself because I have not abstracted
the haproxy configuration. The template has my values hard coded right now.

Role enables HAProxy stats at url https://load-balancer:443/haproxy?stats

Required Variables:
  - certHost - Host where certbot was ran to acquire certificate from Letsencrypt
  - domain
  - statsUser # Stats username and password credentials when prompted for stats
  - statsPass
