Configures self signed certificates for all hosts at /etc/pki/tls/certs/{{ inventory_hostname }}.crt

All certs are fetched back onto the controller. These certs are then distributed to all 
hosts at /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchor.
Each host will update its certificate store withh the command update-ca-trust.

This is a pretty simple of way of making sure all your hosts trust each other internally.

Setting up your own CA scales easier, but I like the simplicity of this solution,
sicne certificates are so critical to configuration, and I want to guarentee its running correctly.
